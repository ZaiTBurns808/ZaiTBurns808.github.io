## Starting Off In HTML
In my Software Engineering course at UH Manoa, I have been contantly challenged with the introdution of new avenues in programming and software development. HTML and CSS are no exceptions. Having no previous experience with UI design and web development in general, they were both extremely difficult to learn to say the least. Despite doing hours of informational tutorials on each of them, getting used to even reading them was a hurdle in and of itself. I was able to get a good grasp on them after much trial and error, however, it only got harder from there. 

## Bootstrap 5
Bootstrap 5 is a UI framework which is used as a means to "easier" create responsive websites with some premade yet fully customizable templates. The reason I put emphasis on the word "easier", however, is because learning to use it initially is anything but easy. Sure, creating a decent starting point for a web page can be plenty simpler with the use of Bootstrap, but the need to learn a wide variety of new tools just to make a stylish site is extremely painful, especially when the proccess of making a website is so frequently interupted by having to scrub through long pages of documentation.

## Why use it?
Despite these sour words of disdain that I have for Bootstrap, I still find it quite necessary for an individual who intends to do web development to use it, and even become "fluent" in it's utilization. Just using raw HTML or CSS might seem better at first, but after gaining a lot of experience with the framework, a huge variety of benefits surface. For one, creating a website (once the user is well versed in Bootstrap) will become much more efficient when done with a UI framework. Not only that, but stylistically a site that is developed using Bootstrap will be much more consistent, as it promotes the creation of consistent designs and patterns across a web page. 

## My Very Own Bootstrap Webpage
With my personal experience being very limited, I was tasked in my Software Engineering course to recreate the UI of a website of my choice using Bootstrap 5. For my site, I chose to replicate the website of my Elementary school. As I lacked any experience with Bootstrap (and barely any in HTML for that matter), the UI took very long to replicate, especially when presented with the challenge of creating visually similar formatting and style. Overall, however, despite the various times I was road blocked by my lack of knowledge, I see why a UI framework like Bootstrap can be extremely useful, and I do intend to use it or a similar framework in the future. Below lies an image of my attempt at recreating the website (left) as well as the original site I was trying to mimic (right).

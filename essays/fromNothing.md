## Starting Off In HTML
In my Software Engineering course at UH Manoa, I have been constantly challenged with the introduction of new avenues in programming and software development. HTML and CSS are no exceptions. Having no previous experience with UI design and web development in general, they were both extremely difficult to learn, to say the least. Despite spending hours on informational tutorials for each of them, getting used to even reading the code was a hurdle in and of itself. However, I was able to get a good grasp on them after much trial and error. Still, it only got harder from there.

## Bootstrap 5
Bootstrap 5 is a UI framework used to "easily" create responsive websites with pre-made yet fully customizable templates. The reason I put emphasis on the word "easily," however, is because learning to use it initially is anything but easy. Sure, creating a decent starting point for a web page can be much simpler with the use of Bootstrap, but the need to learn a wide variety of new tools just to make a stylish site is extremely painful, especially when the process of making a website is so frequently interrupted by having to sift through long pages of documentation.

## Why use it?
Despite these frustrations with Bootstrap, I still find it quite necessary for anyone who intends to pursue web development to use it, and even become "fluent" in its utilization. Initially, using raw HTML or CSS might seem better, but after gaining significant experience with the framework, a huge variety of benefits become apparent. For one, creating a website (once the user is well-versed in Bootstrap) becomes much more efficient. Not only that, but stylistically, a site developed using Bootstrap will be much more consistent, as it promotes the creation of uniform designs and patterns across a web page.

## My Very Own Bootstrap Webpage
With my personal experience being very limited, I was tasked in my Software Engineering course to recreate the UI of a website of my choice using Bootstrap 5. For my site, I chose to replicate the website of my elementary school. As I lacked experience with Bootstrap (and barely any in HTML for that matter), the UI took a long time to replicate, especially when presented with the challenge of creating visually similar formatting and style. Overall, despite the various times I was roadblocked by my lack of knowledge, I see why a UI framework like Bootstrap can be extremely useful, and I do intend to use it or a similar framework in the future. Below is an image of my attempt at recreating the website (left), as well as the original site I was trying to mimic (right). I feel that something like this, although seemingly difficult, would have been significantly harder in plain html and css.

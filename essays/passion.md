Choosing a career path that one truly loves is an arduous task for any young person, though for myself it was quite different. I have a variety of passions in my personal life, from cinematography to biology, though nothing has stuck out to me as much as Computer Science has. At age ten I was introduced to basic coding by my Computer Scientist Uncle, who showed me how to make a simple "higher or lower" game in Python. From that moment on, I was entralled. I spent a lot of my free time on coding websites like codingbat with the dream of being able to make whatever I want. I continued through my formative years already knowing what I wanted to do when I grow old, and now I intend to continue on that path.

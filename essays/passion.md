## A Whole New World
Choosing a career path that one truly loves is an arduous task for any young person, though for myself it was quite different. I have a variety of passions in my personal life, from cinematography to biology, though nothing has stuck out to me as much as Computer Science has. At age ten I was introduced to basic coding by my Computer Scientist Uncle, who showed me how to make a simple "higher or lower" game in Python. From that moment on, I was entralled. It was a whole new world for me to explore, all from the comfort of my grandma's neglected old office chair. I spent a lot of my free time on coding websites like CodingBat with the dream of one day being able to make whatever I want. I continued through my formative years already knowing what I wanted to do when I grow old, and now I am at UH Manoa to continue on that path. 

## Maintaining Interest
Over these years I have been exposed to a wide range of elements of computer science, including data science, cyber security, software development, and game development. As much as I have done in these departments, I find all of these to be equally enjoyable and I still lack the conviction to stick to one in particular. I have the most experience in game development in particular, as I have worked on four different projects so far, and have become the most accustomed to C++ because of it. I feel that this is just the most fun, as it allows me to work with people who are equally as artistically driven and passionate as I am. 

## Towards The Future
In order to continue to fuel the fire of passion that I have in my career, I intend to continue in strive by being more dilligent in my coursework and personal life. I would primarily for the forseeable future like to develop the ability to better become self sufficient in my learning, as a lot of my own abilities are often roadblocked by a lack of time spent on personal projects. Sure, working in a group is a great way to find motivation, but I would like to become able to work towards goals by myself. I also would like to become more proficient in documenting projects, as I feel that I lack the capability to effectively communicate my vision for my projects to others. Focusing on my higher level classes (currently ICS311 and ICS314) will best help me achieve these goals so long that I am dilligent and stay on track.

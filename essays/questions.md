## Why ask smart questions?
  An engineer's most valuable skill is the ability to take the lessons from failures or lack of understanding and find ways to convert it to results. Asking detailed yet concise questions is essential to learning best in any environment, and the internet is no different. Websites like StackOverflow which feature forums for asking computer and software engineering related questions are full of questions, many of which leave much to be desired. But what qualifies a question as good? This essay reviews two examples of questions asked on StackOverflow which have great contrast in their quality, and discusses what they do right (or wrong). I then will reflect on smart questions as a whole, and how I can utilize this information in the future to help me learn better. 

## A not so smart example
  One of the most negatively voted forum posts on StackOverflow comes from a post made [eight years ago in 2016](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39601887/why-am-i-getting-nosuchelementexception-in-this-hackerrank-challenge), with the header *Why am I getting NoSuchElementException in this HackerRank challenge?*. The contents of the post are simply the user linking the website which contains the instructions to a challenge, a copy of the user's console error, the code that they wrote, followed only by "Why am I getting this error?". This question is problematic for a great number of reasons. For one, the titling convention is already a huge red flag. Rather than specifying what they are trying to create and what the error is, they only list the object which they are creating as "HackerRank challenge". This problem is even further apparent by the fact that the user only left a link of the prompt they are trying to solve rather than just summarizing the prompt itself. Additionally, the act of asking for help on a challenge/homework on this type of forum is already considered inappropriate, as asking for solution help on these challenges that are intended to help you learn is counter productive. Simply asking a question like this in a different forum or at the very least only asking for a hint would be much better. 

  A question as poorly structured as this, even as simple as the content itself is to solve, can only be given an answer with so much. Luckily for the user in this case, someone provided a very well detailed response which goes over exactly why the user encountered this error. The answer (as it was given after the contest was already over), also featured a link to the solution. However, despite the quality of the answer, it really didn't do the user much good. The user gained nothing valuable from the answer, as the whole point of the challenge was to be a challenge, not necessarily for the code to be completed at all, especially with external help. All in all, it would have been best for this question to not be asked in general, as it defeats the purpose of the challenge in the first place. 

## Even a simple, fun question can be smart
  Many of the questions on StackOverflow which receive the most positive feedback are the most simple. One case of this that I found particularly interesting was from a post made [six years ago in 2018](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48270127/can-a-1-a-2-a-3-ever-evaluate-to-true) titled *Can (a== 1 && a ==2 && a==3) ever evaluate to true?*. The contents of the post are very concise, restating the question and saying that the question is an interview question of a major tech company. They also say that they are aware that this is never a situation that would be encountered on a day to day basis, but that they are just curious. This question is great for a number of reasons. For one, the header is fully relevant and concise, providing anyone who sees it perfect context for the question. Also, the context they provide within the post proves the question to be very casual, as they specify that they are just curious. Lastly, and to great contrast to the previous question, this question's origin is not from an assignment or challenge that the user was trying to solve, but rather from a place of genuine curiosity. Sure, it is an interview question, but one that presents itself as a brain teaser and is therefore inherently useful for others on the forum to know the answer of. 

  As this question is so simple and well structured, the answers reply very concisely and clearly. The most popular answer replies saying that it is indeed possible, and provides an example of how that would be. They also provide a link to a reading on the '==' operator, and briefly describes which its properties makes this possible. Overall this question is a great example of a way to ask a fun question that is also helpful to yourself and others. 

## What to learn from this
  After seeing these questions and learning what makes for a smart question, it is now apparent what I as a software engineer (and student in general) have to do in order to get good responses from people. Being specific, providing all necessary information, being formal, and providing the reasoning for the question are all components of a good question. Now that I know all of this, I can proceed to forum sites like StackOverflow as well as basic conversations with much more confidence in my ability to ask for help.

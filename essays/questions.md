## Why ask smart questions?
  An engineer’s most valuable skill is the ability to take lessons from failures or a lack of understanding and find ways to convert them into results. Asking detailed yet concise questions is essential for learning in any environment, and the internet is no different. Websites like StackOverflow, which feature forums for asking computer science and software engineering-related questions, are full of posts, many of which leave much to be desired. But what qualifies a question as good? This essay reviews two examples of questions asked on StackOverflow that contrast greatly in quality, and discusses what they do right (or wrong). I will then reflect on smart questions as a whole and how I can utilize this information in the future to help me learn better.

## A not so smart example
  One of the most negatively voted forum posts on StackOverflow comes from a post made eight years ago in 2016, with the title "Why am I getting NoSuchElementException in this HackerRank challenge?". The contents of the post consist of the user linking the website containing the instructions for a challenge, a copy of the user’s console error, the code they wrote, followed only by “Why am I getting this error?”. This question is problematic for several reasons. For one, the title is already a huge red flag. Rather than specifying what they are trying to create and what the error is, they only list the object they are creating as a “HackerRank challenge.” This problem is further compounded by the fact that the user only provided a link to the prompt they are trying to solve, rather than summarizing the prompt itself. Additionally, asking for help on a challenge or homework on this type of forum is generally considered inappropriate, as it undermines the purpose of these challenges, which are intended to help users learn. Simply asking for help in a different forum or, at the very least, only asking for a hint would have been much more appropriate.

A question as poorly structured as this, even though the content itself is simple to solve, can only receive a limited response. Luckily for the user in this case, someone provided a very detailed answer explaining why the error occurred. The answer (which was given after the contest had already ended) also included a link to the solution. However, despite the quality of the answer, it didn’t do the user much good. The whole point of the challenge was to be a challenge, not necessarily for the code to be completed at all, especially with external help. All in all, it would have been better if this question had never been asked, as it defeats the purpose of the challenge in the first place.

## Even a simple, fun question can be smart
Many of the questions on StackOverflow that receive the most positive feedback are the simplest. One example that I found particularly interesting is a post made six years ago in 2018, titled "Can (a == 1 && a == 2 && a == 3) ever evaluate to true?". The contents of the post are very concise, restating the question and explaining that it is an interview question from a major tech company. The user also mentions that they are aware this is not a situation likely to be encountered on a day-to-day basis but are just curious. This question is great for several reasons. First, the title is fully relevant and concise, providing perfect context for the question. Second, the context within the post shows that the question is casual, as the user specifies they are simply curious. Lastly, and in contrast to the previous question, this question originates from genuine curiosity, not from an assignment or challenge the user is trying to solve. While it is an interview question, it presents itself as a brain teaser, making it inherently useful for others on the forum to know the answer.

Because this question is so simple and well-structured, the answers are concise and clear. The most popular answer confirms that it is indeed possible, provides an example of how that would occur, includes a link to a reading on the ‘==’ operator, and briefly describes which properties of the operator make this possible. Overall, this question is a great example of how to ask a fun question that is helpful to both yourself and others.

## What to learn from this
After reviewing these questions and learning what makes a question smart, it is now clear what I, as a software engineer (and student in general), must do to get good responses from people. Being specific, providing all necessary information, being formal, and explaining the reasoning behind the question are all components of a good question. Now that I understand these principles, I can approach forum sites like StackOverflow, as well as basic conversations, with much more confidence in my ability to ask for help.

## Introduction  

Regardless of your stance on the matter, AI is the next technological boom that the future is propelling toward. Something unthinkable in the past is now commonplace and rapidly growing and changing. Nowadays, we as students and those who teach us are finding ways to utilize AI in ways previously impossible. In the field of computer science, this is especially relevant, as AI is incredibly powerful when writing and interpreting code. Utilizing AI software like ChatGPT or Bard to explain concepts or write code has become commonplace at both the college level and the workplace. Personally, I have utilized AI (particularly ChatGPT) in ICS314 to varying degrees of success and at various frequencies.  

## 1. Experience with WODs  

One of my most frequent uses of AI in the course of ICS314 was in the home WODs. I typically did two attempts: one before watching the screencast and another afterward, with the second attempt utilizing AI. This approach allowed me to metaphorically bash my head against the wall, ingraining the problems into my mind so that when the solution was presented, I could better understand and recognize it in the future. For example, during the “digits” assignments, I had significant trouble with my first attempts to get everything to look exact. Using ChatGPT allowed me to assemble the style of the pages with minimal hassle.  

## 2. In-Class Practice WODs  

Depending on the context of the class time, I used AI to varying degrees for practicing WODs. Typically, when I got stuck, I wouldn’t try to use it but would instead spend time with my partner troubleshooting. However, when we were truly stuck, we used it to get us out of the mud and allow us to progress. For example, with Murphy's practice WOD, I used ChatGPT to troubleshoot the spacing of the page, as I didn’t yet fully understand containers. I submitted a screenshot and asked it to “Take the example in this file and modify and add elements to match the screenshot.”  

## 3. In-Class WODs  

During class WODs, due to the strict time constraints and the significant impact on my grade, I found it essential to use AI, even to a small extent. This made the WODs much easier. In one case (I forgot which one in particular, but I believe it was the React WOD), ChatGPT had almost fully finished my mockup with just the screenshot I provided and the prompt, “In React, create this mockup.” While it was astonishing how effective this was, it raises the question of whether I actually learned anything in that case.  

## 4. Essays  

For essays, I believe that having AI write content for me is cheating, although it can be useful. However, in this class in particular, I used AI to make formatting in HTML much easier, as it made my essays neat and stylish in mere seconds, which would otherwise take a long time. Additionally, I used it to find examples within my own code that highlighted what I was discussing in my essays. For example, in my professional portfolio design patterns essay, I had ChatGPT find examples of what I was describing within my code. The essay itself was also formatted with ChatGPT.  

## 5. Final Project  

For the final project, utilizing previously made mockups to prompt AI to make new mockups was a godsend. It saved a ton of time asking ChatGPT to do so, as it kept the general style of the code and the page itself consistent. For example, when making all of the admin page mockups, I only had to make one mockup and then asked ChatGPT to format the rest of that one. This way, they all looked similar with functionality differences.  

## 6. Learning a Concept / Tutorial  

In order to learn some concepts not discussed in screencasts, especially those discussed briefly in lecture segments, AI was instrumental in explaining complex topics. I find that many software engineers, when explaining concepts, use terminology or examples that are foreign to those at my level, and ChatGPT was able to break these topics down into much simpler terms. For example, it greatly helped me understand design patterns, as it was scarcely discussed throughout the course, if at all.  

## 7. Answering a Question in Class or in Discord  

I find that answering questions in class using ChatGPT was very useful, as it provided a sort of conversational lubricant when we were prompted but got stuck with no answer. Answering questions about, say, general software engineering questions would spark discussion even if ChatGPT wasn’t on the nose with the answer.  

## 8. Asking or Answering a Smart Question  

I found that asking smart questions or answering them didn’t require me to use ChatGPT. However, I found that it was nice to supplement troubleshooting with ChatGPT and provide information on what GPT gave me, and in some cases, asking why what it suggested didn't work. That being said, I never did this firsthand and merely witnessed it.  

## 9. Coding Example  

Asking ChatGPT to provide an example of similar code was the most appropriate use of AI in my opinion in my work. I found that it allowed me to actually remember the solutions that ChatGPT provided rather than just copying and pasting. For example, asking ChatGPT to provide an example of utilizing a bootstrap element so that I could explore the element further myself was commonplace.  

## 10. Explaining Code  

I feel as though personally I never really used ChatGPT to explain code, at least not in this course. Not for any reason in particular—I feel that the only reason I’d ever be looking at code I don’t understand is because ChatGPT wrote it, and it usually does a good job of explaining it when it provides it the first time anyway.  

## 11. Writing Code  

Using ChatGPT to write code that is “grunt work” feels essential, as I find things like formatting, rewriting the same lines of code, or copying something to different files to be extremely boring and demotivating. Asking ChatGPT to simply, for example, “Make placeholder images utilizing these classNames and this format” made it so that I could get to the more engaging parts faster.  

## 12. Documenting Code  

I never used ChatGPT to document code. I find personally that if you are going to write comments in your code and really don’t know what to write, having GPT explain it to you and THEN writing comments yourself is better, as it helps you actually understand what you’re working with.  

## 13. Quality Assurance  

ChatGPT for bug fixing was the most important use of AI that I had personally in writing code. Asking ChatGPT to interpret the error for me and potentially fix it made coding twice as efficient. That being said, troubleshooting in situations where ChatGPT does not have enough information to sufficiently help you is still vital, and it is important to understand that a good coder needs to be able to do that. For example, when ChatGPT doesn’t know the routing of, say, the final project, it struggles with explaining errors related to it. I found that for those kinds of errors, it was better to ask others for help instead.  

## 14. Other Uses in ICS314  

One use of AI in ICS314 not necessarily specific to the course is brainstorming creative ideas. The ability to type a prompt and be given a near-infinite amount of potential ideas to get me started on, say, a my-choice assignment was priceless. I often find that getting an idea and measuring the logistics of it is the most difficult part of starting a project. For me, giving ChatGPT a list of my interests and asking it to generate a list of websites to potentially mock up for my choice assignments was really helpful.  

## Learning  

Generally speaking, AI was beneficial for learning software development. It allowed me to comprehend topics I might have otherwise ignored and develop skills at a faster pace. I didn’t need to waste as much time on grunt work or basic troubleshooting, which made the learning process more efficient.  

## Practical Applications  

Outside the context of the course, AI has great potential for a wide range of applications. However, many companies misuse and misunderstand AI, often adopting it without considering long-term consequences. For example, AI tools like Google’s Bard sometimes provide incorrect information. This misinformation can be dangerous, and society must carefully assess whether AI should be used for certain tasks unrelated to productivity in fields like software engineering.  

## Challenges  

Some challenges I encountered with AI include becoming too dependent on it for understanding concepts. I feel that if I were to research a topic on a site like GeeksforGeeks or W3Schools, I would struggle more than I did before using AI. Knowing how to find information and ask questions outside of AI remains important. To address this, emphasizing non-AI sources in assignments may be essential.  

## Comparative Analysis  

Compared to traditional teaching, AI has both benefits and drawbacks. It provides a level of consistency and fosters self-learning, which previously required textbooks that weren’t always necessary. However, human interaction and engagement remain vital for effective learning. Instructors who encourage exploration and curiosity can inspire students in ways AI cannot.  

## Future Considerations  

In the future, integrating AI into every classroom, not just ICS314, may be beneficial. Instructors should educate students on both effective and ethical AI usage, as it represents an unavoidable shift in education and the workplace.  

## Conclusion  

AI in the classroom, especially for software engineers, is a useful tool that should be treated as a primary focus for instructors. When used responsibly, AI can help students become self-sufficient at a much faster rate. The current structure of ICS314’s AI integration is effective, but there is room for further experimentation and optimization.

## Why Have Standardization? 
In the realm of software engineering and coding in general, there is a never ending debate about whether or not code should be standardized, and what said standards should be. On one hand, many argue that standardizing coding beyond some universally agreed upon practices (such as naming, commenting, etc) are inherently trivial and completely unecessary. Others believe that creating extremely strict standardized formatting for code is a good way to ensure that code is universally easy to follow, among other benefits. Personally, my experience with these standards is very limited, as I have only really had to focus on them in the past week, even after years of general coding practice. 

## ESLint
ESLint is an extension that can be invoked in an IDE such as VsCode which has a list of configurable rules for JavaScript. It identifies when a program does not follow the standardized coding practices which it deploys, getting even as specific as spacing and type casting. For my ICS314 class, I will be using ESLint going forward to maintain standardized coding practices, as it is required for the course. Thus far, I have had quite a lot of mixed feelings about ESLint, and the idea of standardization as a whole. 

## My Thoughts
Although I am in the camp which believes that standardizing coding practices is largely beneficial, actually working with a program like ESLint has brought as much frustrations as it does make my code look flawless. Creating new functions, for example, tends to be annoying as Lint relentlessly throws errors unitl the code is absolutely perfect. A huge mitigating factor of this, however, is when utilizing AI. ChatGPT, for example, can be prompted to fix any ESLint errors, making the code you provided fit with Lint and therefore very readable and appealing to look at. I have used AI a lot in this context, fixing my code so that ESLint does not throw any errors. In conclusion, I see it fit to standardize coding practices, especially in the modern era where tools like ChatGPT can be easily utilized to also assist in the standardization of code.

## A New Language
TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript, is a programming language which is primarily implemented in web development. As an intermediate experienced Computer Science student, I have experience in a variety of languages, such as C++ and Python. However, JavaScript and by extension TypeScript are entirely new to me, as I have never previously used either language for any implementation. Recently, for ICS314 at UH Manoa, it has become one of the primary languages relevant in my coursework. The process of learning new syntax is familiar to me, and something that I continue to improve on. As with any new language the roadblocks encountered are often tedious to deal with, but continuous practice and scouring online resources has helped me overcome this. 

## Practice, Practice
In ICS314 we have so far had four assignments utilizing TypeScript, all of which I feel that I have performed quite well on. These assignments are known as WODs and practice WODs, daily exercises that test my knowledge on the language. Out of these WODs, one in particular proved to have a sizable roadblock being the third one. “isUnique”, a programming challenge that I am all too familiar with in my years of coding experience actually proved to be a unique challenge for me when working with TypeScript. I was allotted twelve minutes to complete the assignment, of which required me to parse a string and determine whether all of its characters were unique. I already was familiar with the required algorithm: a simple nested for loop that parsed each letter in the string. However, due to a lack of experience with the language, I was left at a roadblock: no matter what I seemed to do the test cases were simply incorrect! I scrambled to find a working solution, but ultimately decided to use ChatGPT (which is permitted for WODs) to ask where my syntax was incorrect. It pointed out that my if statement required a triple equals sign rather than a double like I am familiar with in Java. This way the operands were checked to be equal in both value and type. Thanks to this discovery, I fixed the issue and was able to finish in a decent time of seven minutes. 

## Conclusion
WIth these four (albeit simple) TypeScript assignments under my belt, I feel as though I can comfortably say that my experiences with it so far have informed me that it is just as difficult to learn as any other programming language that I picked up in the past. However, as I learn more and more about TypeScript, the more I can see how the practical applications of it interest me as a developer. In Software Engineering, the ability to develop web applications is outstandingly useful, and is additionally an avenue I can explore on my own. Creating my own websites, even if just for fun, is an endeavor that I am excited to explore with TypeScript in the near future, as it may reveal to me that I enjoy web development as an aspect of programming.

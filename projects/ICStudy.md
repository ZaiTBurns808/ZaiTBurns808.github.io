For the final project for my ICS314 class, I was fortunate to work with a group of four capable, cooperative, and fun classmates to develop a website of our choosing. Our group decided to name ourselves "The Software Engineers" for the sake of the project—an admittedly dull name we chose for the sake of humor. To get our feet off the ground for the project, we tackled a prompt provided by the instructors: an application where students could create and join study sessions to help one another and collaborate on homework, specifically within the ICS space. The goal was to ensure that students who needed help would have a safe space to get it.

Tackling this prompt proved to be quite challenging, even beyond the typical difficulties of group projects. Ensuring we all shared the same vision for the project was particularly tricky, but I feel that my biggest contribution (aside from working on implementation) was ensuring that this vision remained consistent across the team. To achieve this, I organized team meetings and established consistent communication channels within the group, especially when it came to discussing what features we could realistically implement.

In the end, although our project met the minimum requirements to be a functioning and usable product, I feel it could have been much greater—perhaps even practically usable by students outside of our testing environment. Ignoring the time constraints that limited the project's potential, I believe our scope could have been more ambitious. More effort should have been put into improving the site's visual appeal, and the back-end functionality could have been enhanced to make the website more consistent and satisfying to use.

That said, I am proud of my group and the work we accomplished. This project taught me invaluable skills in software development that I might not have gained for a long time otherwise.
